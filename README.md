## Filter by Preference

Users can quickly narrow down their choices based on the following preferences:

**Library**: Select your preferred library from a list of available options. Whether you're looking for a quiet study room in the Robarts Library or a meeting space in the Gerstein Library, you can easily find rooms in the library that suits you best.

**Date**: Pick the exact date that works for you. The app lets you filter rooms based on a specific day, so you can find availability without having to scroll through irrelevant options.

**Number of Attendees**: Specify how many people will be attending your meeting or study session. The app will filter available rooms based on the number of attendees, ensuring that the space you book has enough capacity to comfortably accommodate everyone.

By adjusting these filters, you can quickly and efficiently find the best room that matches all of your preferences, saving you time and effort. No more navigating between pages or going back and forth to check availability â€“ everything you need is right at your fingertips.

### Delete Unwanted Bookings
Plans change, and deleting any booking you no longer need is simple. Each booking displays a delete button next to it, which, when clicked, will remove the booking from your list.

# Challenges and Solutions

## Calling the APIs
While we've successfully developed both the frontend and backend of the application, the key challenge lies in ensuring seamless communication between the two. Establishing robust API calls is crucial for ensuring that data flows smoothly between the user interface and the server, and that users can interact with their bookings in real time.

## User Interactions with Their Bookings
Users can view and manage their bookings directly through the app. They are presented with a list of their current reservations, with the ability to delete any booking they no longer need. This functionality allows for users to have full control over their scheduled rooms, and the option to opt out of a booking when not needed. 

## User authentication 
As our platform serves the University of Toronto community, user authentication is a critical part of the system. To maintain security and ensure that only authorized individuals can make bookings, users must sign in with their university credentials. If a user is not signed in, they will be unable to access their bookings, and an error message will be displayed.
